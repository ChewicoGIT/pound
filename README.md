# Pound emulator
Pound is likely the first real contendor as a Switch 2 emulator.

Progress will start on the CPU as it is nearly identical to Switch 1, and later on smoothing out the differences between the two hardware.

Users will need to dump their own firmware from their own Switch 2 console to use Pound (dump in /assets/fw/)

Pound will likely use some code from other Switch 1 emulators such as Yuzu and will specify which code in the documentation.
