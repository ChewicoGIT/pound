# Pound emulator
Pound is likely the first real contendor as a Switch 2 emulator.

Progrss will start on the CPU and firmware as it is nearly identical to Switch 1, and later on smoothing out the differences between the two hardware.

Pound will likely use some code from other Switch 1 emulators such as Yuzu and will specify which ones in the documentation.
