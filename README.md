## Overview

**Pound** is an early **Nintendo Switch 2** emulator for Android, macOS (Intel and ARM), Windows and Linux (Intel and ARM).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Pound is very early in development, don't expect any miracles.

Development will begin with the **CPU**, as its architecture is nearly identical to the original Switch. After that, work will focus on bridging the differences between the two hardware generations.

## How to compile Pound

See [documentation](/docs/compguide.md)

## Codebase

Pound may reuse certain components from existing Nintendo Switch 1 emulators, such as **Yuzu**.
All reused code will be explicitly documented and credited in the appropriate sections of the repository.
