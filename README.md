## Overview

**Pound** aims to be one of the first functional emulators for the **Nintendo Switch 2**.

Development will begin with the **CPU**, as its architecture is nearly identical to the original Switch. After that, work will focus on bridging the differences between the two hardware generations.

## How to compile Pound

See [documentation](/docs/compguide.md)

## Codebase

Pound may reuse certain components from existing Nintendo Switch 1 emulators, such as **Yuzu**.
All reused code will be explicitly documented and credited in the appropriate sections of the repository.
